There are several different types of yells:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `GET` -- you want to get a thing and they should give it to you\n",
    "+ `POST` -- you want to send them a thing and they should at least write you a thank you card; if they want to give you something back that's cool but it's not expected (but it's polite, so, that's basically the same as expectation, but with all sorts of passive aggressiveness tacked on)\n",
    "+ `HEAD` -- you want to get a thing but you would prefer it if they just told you about the thing first, like sent you a picture of it or told you how big it was. You may still want to get it at some point but you're just testing the water\n",
    "+ `PUT` -- a really pushy `POST` request, basically they tell us they have a cool painting and we say OUR PAINTING HERE IS BETTER EFF YOURS\n",
